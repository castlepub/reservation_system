# Widget Implementation Summary

## What was implemented

I've successfully implemented the multi-step reservation widget for The Castle Pub as requested. Here's what we've built:

### 1. Multi-Step Widget Flow

The widget now has a proper step-by-step flow:

1. **Introduction Step**: Shows the pub info and terms with language toggle (EN/DE) and "OK" button
2. **Basics Step**: Select people, date, and duration - shows available time slots  
3. **Rooms Step**: Shows available rooms for the selected time with availability status
4. **Reason Step**: Select the occasion (dining, birthday, party, team event, fun, special event)
5. **Details Step**: Enter personal details, consent checkboxes, and final submission

### 2. Language Toggle (EN/DE)

- Added EN/DE buttons in the top right
- Full translation support for all widget text
- German translations for all labels, messages, and terms links

### 3. Room Availability Validation

- When a time is selected, the widget checks each room's availability for that specific time
- Shows "Available" or "Unavailable" status for each room
- Only allows selection of available rooms
- Uses the existing `/api/availability` endpoint with room-specific checks

### 4. Room Descriptions

The widget displays proper room descriptions as provided in the room data from the backend.

### 5. Terms and Privacy Pages

- Created `/terms` and `/privacy` endpoints in the FastAPI app
- Added `static/terms.html` and `static/privacy.html` with basic legal content
- Widget links to these pages in the final step

### 6. Enhanced Duration Options

- Added "until end of day" option alongside 2, 3, 4 hours
- Backend handles the special "until-end" value properly

### 7. Guest Details and Consent

The final step collects:
- First name, Last name
- Phone, Email  
- Consent for feedback emails (optional)
- Consent for marketing emails (optional)
- Links to terms and privacy policy

### 8. Backend Integration

- Updated `AvailabilityRequest` schema to accept optional `time` parameter
- Modified availability endpoint to handle room-specific time validation
- Widget submits to existing `/api/reservations` endpoint
- Includes consent information in reservation notes

### 9. Error Handling

- Proper loading states and error messages
- Form validation before submission
- Localized error messages in both languages

## How it works

1. User lands on widget showing introduction and language toggle
2. Clicks "OK" to start the booking process
3. Selects party size, date, and duration
4. Available time slots appear based on overall availability
5. User selects a time slot
6. Widget shows rooms with real-time availability for that specific time
7. User selects an available room
8. User chooses the occasion/reason for their visit
9. User enters personal details and consent preferences
10. Final submission creates the reservation via the existing public API

The widget is fully functional and integrated with your existing reservation system infrastructure.

## Files Modified/Created

- `static/widget.html` - Complete multi-step widget implementation
- `static/terms.html` - Terms and conditions page  
- `static/privacy.html` - Privacy policy page
- `app/main.py` - Added routes for /terms and /privacy
- `app/schemas/reservation.py` - Added optional time parameter to AvailabilityRequest
- `app/api/public.py` - Updated to handle "until-end" duration option

The implementation follows the exact flow you described and provides a smooth, professional booking experience for your guests.
