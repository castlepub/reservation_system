# Layout System Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **404 "Table layout not found" Errors**
**Problem**: The frontend was trying to update table positions using temporary IDs (`temp_1754477007724`) that don't exist in the database yet.

**Root Cause**: When users add new tables in the layout editor, they get temporary IDs until saved. The frontend was making API calls to update/delete these unsaved tables.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `updateTablePosition()` function to check for temporary IDs and only update local data
- Modified `deleteSelectedTable()` function to handle temporary tables locally
- Modified `updateTableProperties()` function to handle temporary tables locally
- Added proper temporary ID handling throughout the frontend

### 2. **405 Method Not Allowed Errors**
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to DELETE tables using temporary IDs that don't exist in the database.

**Solution**: Added temporary ID detection in `deleteSelectedTable()` function to avoid making API calls for unsaved tables.

### 3. **Performance Issues - Slow Loading**
**Problem**: The layout editor was loading ALL reservations for the entire date, which was very slow.

**Root Cause**: The layout service was querying all reservations without filtering by room.

**Solution**:
- Modified `get_layout_editor_data()` to only load reservations assigned to tables in the specific room
- Fixed the query to use proper table assignment relationships instead of non-existent `assigned_tables` field
- Added caching mechanism to improve performance

### 4. **Database Query Issues**
**Problem**: The layout service was trying to use `assigned_tables` field that doesn't exist in the database.

**Root Cause**: The code was assuming `assigned_tables` was a database field, but it's actually computed from the `ReservationTable` relationship.

**Solution**:
- Fixed all queries to properly use the `ReservationTable` relationship
- Updated `suggest_table_assignment()` method to correctly query table assignments
- Updated table reservation matching logic

### 5. **Missing Error Handling**
**Problem**: Frontend didn't handle temporary IDs properly, leading to confusing error messages.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling for temporary tables
- Added user-friendly messages explaining when tables are saved vs. just updated locally
- Improved error messages throughout the layout system

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Caching System**
- Added in-memory caching for layout editor data with 5-minute TTL
- Cache is automatically cleared when tables are created, updated, or deleted
- Reduces database queries for frequently accessed layout data

### 2. **Optimized Queries**
- Changed from loading all reservations to only room-specific reservations
- Used proper JOIN queries instead of inefficient filtering
- Added database indexes for better performance

### 3. **Frontend Optimizations**
- Reduced unnecessary API calls for temporary tables
- Added local data management for unsaved changes
- Improved user feedback for better UX

## Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. **`app/services/layout_service.py`**
   - Fixed database queries for table assignments
   - Added caching system
   - Optimized reservation loading
   - Fixed table assignment logic

### Frontend Files:
1. **`static/script.js`**
   - Fixed `updateTablePosition()` function
   - Fixed `deleteSelectedTable()` function
   - Fixed `updateTableProperties()` function
   - Improved `saveNewTable()` function
   - Enhanced `saveLayout()` function

## Testing

Created `scripts/test_layout_fixes.py` to verify all fixes work correctly:
- Tests layout editor data loading
- Tests table creation
- Tests table updates
- Tests table deletion

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more 404 errors when moving unsaved tables
2. ✅ No more 405 errors when deleting unsaved tables
3. ✅ Much faster loading of layout editor data
4. ✅ Proper handling of temporary vs. saved tables
5. ✅ Better user experience with clear feedback
6. ✅ Improved performance through caching

## Usage Notes

- Tables created in the layout editor start with temporary IDs (`temp_*`)
- Temporary tables are managed locally until the layout is saved
- Users can move, resize, and delete temporary tables without API calls
- When "Save Layout" is clicked, all temporary tables are saved to the database
- The system now provides clear feedback about what's saved vs. local changes
